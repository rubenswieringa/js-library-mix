js-library-mix
==============

Handful of libraries that should aproximately emulate the workings of the ActionScript library Robotlegs, in Javascript. This repository is a use-case scenario where the serverside logic is implemented as a Ruby on Rails project. However, any serverside language should be fine.

Libraries used (or to be used):
* Rivets (templating/databinding)
* RequireJS (runtime modules)
* Backbone (models/validation)
* PostalJS (messagebus/context)
